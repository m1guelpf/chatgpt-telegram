# ChatGPT-bot

> Interact with ChatGPT

Go CLI to fuels a Telegram bot that lets you interact with [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), a large language model trained by OpenAI.

## Installation

Download the file corresponding to your OS in the [releases page](https://github.com/m1guelpf/chatgpt-telegram/releases/latest):

- `chatgpt-telegram-Darwin-amd64`: macOS (Intel)
- `chatgpt-telegram-Darwin-arm64`: macOS (M1)
- `chatgpt-telegram-Linux-amd64`: Linux
- `chatgpt-telegram-Linux-arm64`: Linux (ARM)
- `chatgpt-telegram-Win-amd64`: Windows

After you download the file, extract it into a folder and open the `env.example` file with a text editor and fill in your credentials. You'll need your bot token, which you can find [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token), and optionally your telegram id, which you can find by DMing `@userinfobot` on Telegram. Save the file, and rename it to `.env`.

> **Note** Make sure you rename the file to _exactly_ `.env`! The program won't work otherwise.

Finally, open the terminal in your computer (if you're on windows, look for `PowerShell`), navigate to the path you extracted the above file (you can use `cd dirname` to navigate to a directory, ask ChatGPT if you need more assistance ðŸ˜‰) and run `./chatgpt-telegram`.

## Authentication

By default, the program will launch a browser for you to sign into your account, and close it once you're signed in. If this setup doesn't work for you (there are issues with the browser starting, you want to run this in a computer with no screen, etc.), you can manually extract your session from your browser instead.

To do this, first sign into ChatGPT on your browser, then open the Developer Tools (right click anywhere in the page, then click "Inspect"), click on the Application tab and then on the Cookies section, and copy the value of the `__Secure-next-auth.session-token` cookie.

You will then have to create a config file in the following location depending on your OS (replace `YOUR_USERNAME_HERE` with your username:

- `~/.config/chatgpt.json`: Linux
- `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME_HERE\AppData\Roaming\chatgpt.json`: Windows
- `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/Library/Application Support/chatgpt.json`: macOS

> **Note** If you have already run the program, the file should exist but be empty. If it doesn't exist yet, you can either run the program or manually create it.

Finally, add your cookie to the file and save it. It should look like this: `{ "openaisession": "YOUR_COOKIE_HERE" }`.

## Docker

It is also possible to launch the bot via the docker image included.

Check [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml) file to understands how to do it.
